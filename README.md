# Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm currently studying for a Master's Degree in Intelligent Systems Engineering at Campus Bio-Medico University of Rome  
🔬 My thesis, developed at Uppsala University (Sweden), focuses on data-driven attacks against safety filters in nonlinear systems  
💡 I'm passionate about AI, cybersecurity, and how intelligent algorithms can be applied to real-world challenges

I’m a curious and adaptable person who enjoys tackling challenges and finding creative solutions.
I’m driven by a strong desire to understand how things work, and I take satisfaction in turning ideas into working solutions.
I thrive under pressure, stay organized, and try to learn something new every day.
